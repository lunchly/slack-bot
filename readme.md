#### Set up your Slack Application
Once you have setup your Botkit development enviroment, the next thing you will want to do is set up a new Slack application via the [Slack developer portal](https://api.slack.com/). This is a multi-step process, but only takes a few minutes.

* [Read this step-by-step guide](https://botkit.ai/docs/provisioning/slack-events-api.html) to make sure everything is set up.

* Check out this [handy video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/us2zdf0vRz0) for setting up this project with Glitch.

Copy `.env.default` to `.env`.

Update the `.env` file with your newly acquired tokens.

Launch your bot application by typing:

`npm run dev` (or `npm run start` in production)

Now, visit your new bot's login page: http://localhost:3000/login
